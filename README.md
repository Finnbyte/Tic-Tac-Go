# Tic-Tac-Go (Properly known as Tic-Tac-Toe)
Fun little game project for making a CLI tic-tac-toe in `go`.

## Some help
### Installation
git clone project and `go build .` when you are inside project directory with terminal/cmd/powershell.

### Commands
I think everything other than what's used in game is self-explanatory.

Okay so in-game your commands should have two things, separated by a space.
They are used for getting the Y and X coordinates of your wanted tile.
Your command should look something like this: 
```ylä vasen``` or ```ala oikea``` or ```keski keskellä```
I will make these in english at some point, but the point was that **your first word is the Y-level (down, mid, up)** and second is your **X position (left, center, right)**

There is a help command in the making.
